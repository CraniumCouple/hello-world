# hello-world
Establishing an account on GitHub and learning how to use it.

While she doesn't entirely know it, my wife is my beta tester. We've created this account to establish repositories for some Office Add-in and website work I'd like to do. Also, I'm considering using this to warehouse some of my code from embedded programming projects (C language stuff). It'd be handy to have it in cloud storage for edit work and perhaps later for collaboration on product development.
